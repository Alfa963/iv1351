-- Show the number of lessons given per month during a specified year. 
-- It shall be possible to retrieve the total number of lessons per month (just one number per month) 
-- and the specific number of individual lessons, group lessons and ensembles (three numbers per month). 
-- This query is expected to be performed a few times per week.

List all instructors who has given more than a specific number of lessons during the current month.
 Sum all lessons, independent of type, and sort the result by the number of given lessons.
 This query will be used to find instructors risking to work too much, and will be executed daily.

Hint: you might want to use a CASE statement in your query to produce the desired output.
